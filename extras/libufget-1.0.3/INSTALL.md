Installation
============

libufget depends on the following software packages and should work on all POSIX
compatible operating systems:
* A C compiler supporting C99
* CMake >= 2.8.10
* SQLITE >= 3.6. ( http://www.sqlite.org )
* MATIO >= 1.3. ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/ )
* CURL >= 7.19 ( http://curl.haxx.se/ )
* libarchive >= 3.0 ( https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive )
* zlib ( http://zlib.net/ )
* bzip2 ( http://www.bzip.org )
* libxz ( http://tukaani.org/xz/ )

Due to the usage of CURL the OpenSSL might be a cross dependency. If the
documentation should be rebuilt Doxygen >= 1.8 is also required.

If all requirements are met the package is configured, built, and installed by:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTAL_PREFIX=<YourInstallPath>
    make
    make install

and the documentation is regenerated by calling `doxygen` in the source
directory. If the -DCMAKE_INSTAL_PREFIX option is not given the software will be
installed into `/usr/local`.

The sections below contain hints about the install procedure on various
common operating systems.


Debian/Ubuntu
-------------
First install all dependencies by:

    sudo apt-get install cmake libmatio-dev libblas-dev libsqlite3-dev \
	                 libcurl4-openssl-dev libarchive-dev liblzma-dev

and then build the package as described above.

CentOS/RedHat Enterprise Linux
------------------------------
Before installing libufget on a CentOS or RedHat Enterprise Linux system you
have to ensure that the EPEL repository is installed on your system and active.
Otherwise not all of the required dependencies can be met.

If the EPEL repository is active the requirements are installed by:

    yum install sqlite-devel libcurl-devel bzip2-devel zlib-devel matio-devel \
	        libarchive-devel openssl-devel blas-devel xz-devel

On CentOS8 / RHEL 8 the matio-devel package is no longer available in the EPEL
repository. Please install REMI's RPM repository to install this package via
yum/dnf. - https://blog.remirepo.net/


OpenSuse
--------
The names of the required packages are similar to the ones provided by the EPEL
repository. Using `zypper` they are installed via

    zypper install cmake sqlite3-devel libcurl-devel libbz2-devel zlib-devel \
	           libmatio-devel libarchive-devel blas-devel  xz-devel
