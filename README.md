# SpTRSV Split Execution Framework
The split execution framework can automatically determine the suitability of an SpTRSV for split-execution, find the appropriate split point, and execute SpTRSV in a split fashion using two SpTRSV algorithms while automatically managing any required inter-platform communication.  The model is implemented as a C++/CUDA library supporting multiple CPU-GPU algorithms.

For more details and performance evaluation and analysis results of the framework, refer to our [TPDS Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9409717)
