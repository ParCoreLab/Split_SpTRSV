# Split_SpTRSV
The split execution framework can automatically determine the suitability of an SpTRSV for split-execution, find the appropriate split point, and execute SpTRSV in a split fashion using two SpTRSV algorithms while automatically managing any required inter-platform communication.  The model is implemented as a C++/CUDA library supporting multiple CPU-GPU algorithms.

Files are being prepared for the upload. Will be available soon.
